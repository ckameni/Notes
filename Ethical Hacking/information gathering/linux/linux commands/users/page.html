<br/>
some time when you are doing Penetration testing, you are going to have access to the <b>etc/passwd</b>&nbsp; file, because it doesn't provide the password. it used to. but <br/>
passwords are now located in the <b>shadow</b>&nbsp;file.<br/>
<br/>
open the etc/passwd file. this file show you all the users<br/>
<b>cat /etc/passwd<br/>
</b><img src="image 2.png" /><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
open the etc/shadow file. where the passwords of the users are store<br/>
<b>cat /etc/shadow</b><br/>

<br/>
switching users<br/>
<b>su</b>&nbsp;john<br/>
<img src="image 4.png" /><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
try to change root password with elevated permission. will fail, because John is a base user.<br/>
<b>sudo passwd root<br/>
</b>we will encounter that &nbsp;a lot of time in penetration testing, where if we get in, we'll get something called Lower priviledge. And will get an account like john, <br/>
and we are going to try to escalate into root. but we cannot just do it. The chance of having a john in &nbsp;a <b>sudoers</b>&nbsp;file, is just not that high. <br/>
if you want a user other that root to have access to file permission, you need to have them in the <b>sudoers</b>&nbsp;file<br/>
