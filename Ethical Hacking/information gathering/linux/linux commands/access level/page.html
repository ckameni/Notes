the tmp folder has full <b>read write execute(rwx)</b>, so when we are doing a penetration testing, we trying to upload some sort of<br/>
exploit. we might actually upload it into the tmp folder because that is where we can execute those files! we also maybe want to find other <br/>
read write execute files, where we can modify them and give us root access to a system. so it's all about insecure configurations.<br/>
<br/>
<b>ls -la</b>&nbsp;/tmp/<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
we can also create a scritp that is not going to execute until it has full access.<br/>
So do we change access?<br/>
<br/>
tripple 7 gives you full access across the board<br/>
<b>chmod &nbsp;777</b>&nbsp;hello.txt &nbsp;<br/>
<b>chmod &nbsp;+x</b>&nbsp;hello.txt<br/>
<img src="image 2.png" /><br/>
